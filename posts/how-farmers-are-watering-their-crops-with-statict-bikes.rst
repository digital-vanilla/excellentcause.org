There are places in the world without basic infrastructure and services where people struggle to survive. Mozambique, Africa, is one of those places but some farmers can water their crops with a water pump bike provided by Green Pedal, a non-profit empowering farmers so they can end hunger in the region.

The water pump bike looks like a peloton bike with no screen, has a repurposed water pump that was thrown away because the electric motor died, but here has a second life and it brings more life to the people that are using them.
