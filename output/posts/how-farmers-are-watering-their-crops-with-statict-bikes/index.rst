There are places in the world without basic infrustructure and services where people strugle to survive. Mozambique, Africa, is one of those places but some farmers are able to water their crops with a waterpump-bike provided by Green Pedal, a non-profit empowering farmers so they can end hunger in the region.

The waterpump-bike looks like a peloton bike with no screen, has a repurpused water pump that was throwned away because the electric motor died, but here has a second life and it brings more life to the people that are using them.
